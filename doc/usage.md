## Description {#l4re_servers_nvme_driver_description}

The NVMe server is a driver for PCI Express NVMe controllers.

The NVMe server is capable of exposing entire disks (i.e. NVMe namespaces) (by
serial number and namespace identifier) or individual partitions (by their
partition UUID) of a hard drive to clients via the Virtio block interface.

The server consists of two parts. The first one is the hardware driver itself
that takes care of the communication with the underlying hardware and interrupt
handling. The second part implements a virtual block device and is responsible
to communicate with clients. The virtual block device translates commands it
receives into NVMe requests and issues them to the hardware driver.

The NVMe server allows both statically and dynamically configured clients. A
static configuration is given priority over dynamically connecting clients and
configured while the service starts. Dynamic clients can connect and disconnect
during runtime of the NVMe server.

## Factory {#l4re_nvme_driver_factory}

The factory of the NVMe server allows creation of the following objects:

- Virtio block host, the VirtIO block interface to a single block device


<hr>
## Capabilities {#l4re_servers_nvme_driver_capabilities}

* `vbus`

  Virtual bus capability

  Mandatory capability.

* `dataspace`

  Trusted dataspaces

  Multiple capability names can be provided by the `--register-ds` command line
  parameter.

* `client`

  Static client

  Multiple capability names can be provided by the `--client` command line
  parameter.

* `svr`

  Server capability providing clients access to a factory interface for creating
  dynamic clients.


<hr>
## Command Line Options {#l4re_servers_nvme_driver_cmdline_options}

In the example above the NVMe server is started in its default configuration. To
customize the configuration of the NVMe-server it accepts the following command
line options:

* `-v`, `--verbose`

  Enable verbose mode. You can repeat this option to increase verbosity up to
  trace level.

  Can be used up to 3 times.

  Flag. True if provided.

* `-q`, `--quiet`

  This option enables the quiet mode. All output is silenced.

  Flag. True if provided.

* `--client <cap_name>`

  Connect a static client.

  Can be used multiple times.

  Name of a provided capability with server rights that adheres to the ipc
  protocol.

  This parameter opens a scope for the following subparameters:

  *
  `--device <<SN>:n<NSID> | <SN>:n<NSID>:<PARTNUM> | [partuuid:]<UUID> | [partlabel:]<LABEL>>`

    This option denotes either the NVMe namespace, or a partition on such a
    namespace to be exported for the client specified in the preceding `client`
    option.

    The NVMe namespace is specified via the NVMe controller serial number SN
    followed by a colon followed by letter 'n' followed by the NSID (namespace
    ID). The controller serial number can be found e.g. in the NVMe server's
    output or in the controller's sysfs directory in Linux.

    The partition can be given either by the combination of the controller's SN
    followed by a colon followed by letter 'n' followed by the NSID followed by
    a colon followed by the partition number PARTNUM, or by the partition's UUID
    or label. Both 'partuuid:' and 'partlabel:' strings are optional and help to
    disambiguate the device matching if necessary.

    String value.

  * `--ds-max <max>`

    This option sets the upper limit of the number of dataspaces the client is
    able to register with the NVMe server for virtio DMA.

    Numerical value.

  * `--readonly`

    This option sets the access to disks or partitions to read only for the
    preceding `client` option.

    Flag. True if provided.

* `--nosgl`

  This option disables support for SGLs.

  Flag. True if provided.

* `--nomsi`

  This option disables support for MSI interrupts.

  Flag. True if provided.

* `--nomsix`

  This option disables support for MSI-X interrupts.

  Flag. True if provided.

* `-d <cap_name>`, `--register-ds <cap_name>`

  This option registers a trusted dataspace capability. If this option gets
  used, it is not possible to communicate to the driver via dataspaces other
  than the registered ones. Can be used multiple times for multiple dataspaces.

  The option's parameter is the name of a dataspace capability.

  Can be used multiple times.

  Name of a provided capability that adheres to the dataspace protocol.

## Building and Configuration {#l4re_servers_nvme_driver_config}

The NVMe server can be built using the L4Re build system. Just place this
project into your `pkg` directory. The resulting binary is called `nvme-drv`

## Starting the service {#l4re_servers_nvme_driver_starting}

The NVMe server can be started with Lua like this:

```lua
local nvme_bus = L4.default_loader:new_channel();
L4.default_loader:start({
  caps = {
    vbus = vbus_nvme,
    svr = nvme_bus:svr(),
  },
},
"rom/nvme-drv");
```

First an IPC gate (`nvme_bus`) is created which is used between the NVMe server
and a client to request access to a particular disk or partition. The
server-side is assigned to the optional `svr` capability of the NVMe server. See
the section below on how to configure access to a disk or partition.

The NVMe server needs access to a virtual bus capability (`vbus`). On the
virtual bus the NVMe server searches for NVMe compliant storage controllers.
Please see io's documentation about how to setup a virtual bus.

## Virtio block host {#l4re_servers_nvme_driver_param_virtio_block_host}

Prior to connecting a client to a virtual block session it has to be created
using the following Lua function. It has to be called on the client side of the
IPC gate capability whose server side is bound to the NVMe server.

Call:
`create(0, "device=<<SN>:n<NSID> | <SN>:n<NSID>:<PARTNUM> | [partuuid:]<UUID> | [partlabel:]<LABEL>>" [, "ds-max=<max>", "read-only"])`

*
`"device=<<SN>:n<NSID> | <SN>:n<NSID>:<PARTNUM> | [partuuid:]<UUID> | [partlabel:]<LABEL>>"`

  This string denotes either the NVMe namespace, or a partition on such a
  namespace that the client wants to be exported via the Virtio block interface.

  The NVMe namespace is specified via the NVMe controller serial number SN
  followed by a colon followed by letter 'n' followed by the NSID (namespace
  ID). The controller serial number can be found e.g. in the NVMe server's
  output or in the controller's sysfs directory in Linux.

  The partition can be given either by the combination of the controller's SN
  followed by a colon followed by letter 'n' followed by the NSID followed by a
  colon followed by the partition number PARTNUM, or by the partition's UUID or
  label. Both 'partuuid:' and 'partlabel:' strings are optional and help to
  disambiguate the device matching if necessary.

  String value.

* `"ds-max=<max>"`

  Specifies the upper limit of the number of dataspaces the client is allowed to
  register with the NVMe server for virtio DMA.

  Numerical value.
    * In the range of 1 to 256 inclusive

  Default: `2`

* `"read-only"`

  This string sets the access to disks or partitions to read only for the
  client.

  Flag. True if provided.

If the `create()` call is successful a new capability which references an NVMe
virtio device is returned. A client uses this capability to communicate with the
NVMe server using the Virtio block protocol.

## Examples {#l4re_servers_nvme_driver_examples}

A couple of examples on how to request different disks or partitions are listed
below.

* **Request an entire NVMe namespace**

  Assume the NVMe server reported an NVMe controller with the following serial
  number (running in QEMU):
  ```
  Serial Number: 1234
  ```

  A client can connect to NSID 1 on this controller like this:
  ```lua
  vda = nvme_bus:create(0, "ds-max=5", "device=1234:n1")
  ```

* **Request a partition using a partition number**

  Assume the NVMe server reported an NVMe controller with the following serial
  number (running in QEMU):
  ```
  Serial Number: 1234
  ```

  A client can connect to partition 2 on namespace 1 on this controller like
  this:
  ```lua
  vda = nvme_bus:create(0, "ds-max=5", "device=1234:n1:2")
  ```

* **Request a partition with the given UUID**

  ```lua
  vda = nvme_bus:create(0, "ds-max=5", "device=partuuid:88E59675-4DC8-469A-98E4-B7B021DC7FBE")
  ```

* **Request a partition using a label**

  Assume there is a partition with label 'foobar'. A client can connect to it
  using the following snippet:
  ```lua
  vda = nvme_bus:create(0, "ds-max=5", "device=partlabel:foobar")
  ```

* **A more elaborate example with a static client.** The client uses the client
side of the `nvme_cl1` capability to communicate with the NVMe server.

  ```lua
  local nvme_cl1 = L4.default_loader:new_channel();
  local nvme_bus = L4.default_loader:new_channel();
  L4.default_loader:start({
    caps = {
      vbus = vbus_nvme,
      svr = nvme_bus:svr(),
      cl1 = nvme_cl1:svr(),
    },
  },
  "rom/nvme-drv --client cl1 --device 88E59675-4DC8-469A-98E4-B7B021DC7FBE --ds-max 5");
  ```
